# birdybot,A simple twitter bot (that contains no everyflavored beans!) Under alpha development.

## Explination of status
Birdybot is currently under alpha development, and not all of it's features or capabilities have been determined, much less coded.
I'm mainly making this because I want a Twitter bot to play with, and didn't want to clone someone elses, as it probably wouldn't do what I wanted it to, and... Well. I like python and twitter so...
You're welcome to provide feedback and suggestions as to where you think Birdybot's features (such as they are) should go in the future.

##Requirements for running
To run Birdybot, you'll need python 2.7 or greater, or 3.3 or greater, as well as tweepy.


##So what can I do with it?
Well... Nothing yet. I have plans for it to run quietly in the background on a unix / linux system, maybe logging the timelines of users on the system who want it to do so, maybe sending a DM to the corresponding twitter username when a user logs into the system over SSH...
Maybe put in a stupid chatbot... As I said, suggestions are welcome!
